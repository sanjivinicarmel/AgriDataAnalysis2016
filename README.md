This project analyzes Indian district and holding size institutional farm credit distribution based on 2016 government data. 
It applies machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Linear Regression) to identify patterns, predict credit need, and identify which districts and farmer groups are not served.

Key Highlights:
Dataset: Over 3,200 records from government surveys, divided by state, district, holding size, loan source, and loan purpose.
Target: Estimated number of functioning holdings utilizing institutional credit.
ML Techniques: Regression models utilized for demand forecasting, credit adoption model, and seasonal loan flow examination.

Insights:
90% of the credit absorbed by small/marginal farmers.
Short-term loans are more dominant due to input requirements during the season.
Medium and large farms are under-leveraged â€“ lenders' growth potential.

Geospatial & Seasonal Trends:
Uttar Pradesh has the highest credit accessibility.
Q2 & Q3 are peak credit demand seasons that overlap with sowing periods.

Applications in Business:
Customized credit product development
Geographically targeted approach by agri-fintechs and financial institutions.
